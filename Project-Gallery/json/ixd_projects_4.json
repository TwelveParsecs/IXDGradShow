      "Process" : "To gather information on the subject, I mainly gained guidance from a market study of current methods of telling the story of depression, which largely included web platforms and physical booklets. In addition, I took the concerns and feedback of families and friends of people with depression, depressives themselves, and the recommendations of a therapist to ensure that multiple viewpoints on the subject were taken into account. In the end I decided to make an interactive depressive experience.",

To motivate people to eat their foods, this app tracks the amount of money a person losses when their food spoils, offering insight into which foods spoil the most in their household and suggesting potential savings if they change their consumption habits.\n",
      "Result" : "Through this experience, I managed to interview consumers, food retailers and food rescue services to gain insight into why so much food waste occurs. What I’ve learned is that consumers believe a wide variety of myths about foods in addition to having a very high and unrealistic standard for the aesthetic of their foods. So I decided to create a platform that people would use to help reduce their own food waste in their household, while at the same time slowly educating and dispelling myths about foods.\n",

      "Description" : "Openbook is an app for reading graphic novels on the go in a simplified way, allowing users to discover old and new favorites in a streamlined experience.",
      "Situation" : "I found through my research that reader apps are often far too bulky, with many unnecessary features that broke immersion while engaging with a novel. ",
      "Problem" : "I needed to design an app that would allow a user to interact with and search for new novels in a way that was simple and easy to navigate without unnecessary features.",
      "Process" : "First I needed to understand how and what my target audience thought about reading graphic novels online as part of my research. From there I created paper prototypes, usability tests, wire frames and mock ups to develop my app before finally programming.",
      "Result" : "Overall, this was a long and involved process that taught me so much regarding development of a brand and how to handle long term projects. I am proud of what I have achieved with this app and hope to be able to develop it further over time.",

      "Situation" : "Thousands of students start college at Sheridan every year, although the resources to navigate college life are readily available, they are expected to learn an extensive amount of information in a short amount of time to adjust to their new surroundings.",
      "Problem" : "How might we condense the quantity of the college information without losing the value, and still address the needs of new students?",
      "Process" : "We broke the down the college information into categories - \"Survive\" includes all financial, registration and student services needs, and \"Thrive\" includes clubs, events, tips and extras.",
      "Result" : "This project was a rewarding experience because working on a small team allowed me to wear many hats, from designing to content creation. The app was showcased at the Sheridan Creates conference and received positive feedback. The project was also awarded with additional grant funding for further development.",
